# Legal Info

## License Compatibility Notice

This project operates under a dual-license structure:
Primary License: All code is distributed under AGPLv3.
Upstream Compatibility: Code inherited from MIT-licensed upstreams retains MIT compatibility where legally required.
Contributor Rights: Contributors retain copyright while licensing their work under AGPLv3.

The AGPLv3 license governs the entire work as distributed. MIT sublicensing applies only to preserve upstream attribution requirements.

## Definitions

Namespace refers to a subdirectory beginning with `_` indicating the authorship of its contents.

Code refers to any C# source code files and compiled assemblies, YML files in `Resources` and any scripts these may require such as the `Tools` subdirectory.

Custom module (Goobmodule, Goob module, Goobmod) refers to an added C# project located with the solution that is specific to this codebase and its contents. Content.Goobstation.Shared is a "goobmod".

Core module (Coremod, coremodule) refers to a C# project that exists within the [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) repository and included files within.

## Copyright

This means they remain at liberty to contribute their work anywhere they please.

## Code license

The project as a whole is licensed under the terms of the [AGPLv3](/LICENSE-AGPLv3.txt) and must be followed regardless of parent licenses.

Distribution must comply with AGPLv3 terms for the work as a whole. Additionally:

For MIT-licensed components: Preserve original MIT license notices and attribution as required by MIT terms, but the AGPLv3 governs redistribution and modification rights for the combined work.

- Code created by contributors of specific downstreams are under their own namespaced directory within Coremod.

- Code created by contributors of Goobstation are under their own Goobmod, commented within Coremod files, namespaced within Coremod, or new files added to coremod (unless otherwise namespaced).

- Upstream code from [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) was taken under [the MIT license](/LICENSE-MIT.txt).
  Any code not in a specific Namespace or commented as such is sublicensed as a block as MIT plus AGPLv3 from the Space Wizards Federation.

- Code taken from [the Starlight project](https://github.com/ss14Starlight/space-station-14) in the `_Starlight` namespace was taken under [their custom MIT-like license](/LICENSE-Starlight.txt) and is distributed under AGPLv3.

Assets have distinct licenses in `attributions.yml` and `meta.json` files which must be followed individually.

## License Precedence

In cases of conflict between license terms, AGPLv3 requirements take precedence for the combined work, while original license attribution requirements must still be satisfied.
