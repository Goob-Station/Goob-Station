#When adding new hardsuits, please try to keep the organization consistent with hardsuit.yml (if possible.)

#For now, since locational damage is not a thing, all "combat" hardsuits (with the exception of the deathsquad hardsuit) have the equvilent of a helmet in terms of armor. This is so people don't need to wear both regular, on-station helmets and hardsuits to get full protection.
#Generally, unless you're adding something like caustic damage, you should probably avoid messing with armor outside of the above scenario.
