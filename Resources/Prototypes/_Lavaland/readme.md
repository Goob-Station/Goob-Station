This folder does not follow any wizden conventions whatsoever.
Why? Because mucho folders for too specific items, it's better to sort them out in files.

The only convention i came up with is that all lavaland items must have `Lavaland` prefix before them.

Enjoy hell.

TODO: FUCK HTN better make it's own system
