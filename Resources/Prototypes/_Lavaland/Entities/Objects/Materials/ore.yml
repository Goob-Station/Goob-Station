# This is kinda shitty, but the other choice is fucking with StackSystem to allow it to track entities so I can keep tabs on which ore specifically has been clained.
# Or cook some nasty shitcode to split the unclaimed value across all of the entities in the stack if there is any. But that feels fairly wonky.
# Enjoy having to shove any new ores here.
