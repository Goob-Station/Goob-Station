# This is where all the wraith abilities are stored at.
# Abilities are structured in a way that each action corresponds in its own component, and its own system.

# For example,
#  - type: entity
#  id: MyAbilities
#  name: A name
#  category: [ HideSpawnMenu ]
#  components:
#  - AbilityOne -> Allows us to perform ActionOne
#  - AbilityTwo -> Allows us to perform ActionTwo
#  - ActionGrant -> Grants us the actions
#    actions:
#    - ActionOne
#    - ActionTwo

# This gets added to the entity either through MapInit or through an event
