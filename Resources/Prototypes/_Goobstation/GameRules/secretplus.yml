# important note: those (and above) weights aren't entirely accurate,
# as secret+ can randomly decide it's not going to use this gamerule
# if it doesn't entirely fit into its remaining budget,
# so if we rolled 850 budget and a rule takes 1000, we have a 15% chance to skip it
# however the amount of effective budget used is reduced for primary rule so this only matters on low/midpop
