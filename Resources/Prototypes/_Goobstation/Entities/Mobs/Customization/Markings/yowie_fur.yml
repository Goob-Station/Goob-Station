# This is the only way I could get it to work, but its still broken
# The right foot always takes priority over the left foot no matter what I do so I'm just leaving it like this
# The players can make weird monstrosities with their feet if they really want to
# Feel free to fix this if you really want to, but I'm going to end up scrapping this if I don't just move on from this
