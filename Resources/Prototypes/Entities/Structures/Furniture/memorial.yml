# At 7:30 AM on March 8th, 2017, ArcLumin, a SS13 contributor, died in a fatal car crash on impact.
# Rest in peace, man. You did good work.
# When a contributor for SS13 dies, all codebases feel it and suffer.
# We may disagree on whether farts should be a thing, or what color to paint the bikeshed,
# but we are all contributors together.
# Goodbye, man. We'll miss you.
# This memorial has been designed for him and any future coders to perish.
