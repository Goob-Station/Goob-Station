  id: Secret
  weights:
    Traitor: 0.30 # Goobstation
    WaveTraitor: 0.10 # Goobstation - Replaces survival as the "Gamemode that Ramps up!!!" needs 30 players however. Rolls agents later and in waves, but extra agents.
    Changeling: 0.15 # Goobstation unique antag
    Traitorling: 0.08 # 2 antags but less of each type applies for all hybrid modes, they all need 30 pop. Also makes lower pops roll more traitor games.
    Nukeops: 0.15 # Goobstation
    NukeTraitor: 0.01
    NukeLing: 0.02
    Revolutionary: 0.10 
    RevTraitor: 0.02
    RevLing: 0.01
    Zombie: 0.04 # Goobstation - Will anyone miss this for wizard?
    Trifecta: 0.02 # Traitor, Changelings and Heretics. Needs 40 players. Basically a way to get heretics in Traitorling.
  #  Survival: 0.05 - Goobstation - Actual Pain. Boring then brutal like an on/off switch to "The orphan Destroyer 8000!"
  #  KesslerSyndrome: 0.01 # Goobstation - remove kessler
  #  Wizard: 0.10 - Remove zombs and take 0.03 from Revs/Nukies...? Maybe add antags to the gamemode besides wizard.
  #  Cult: Wait for dynamic at this point. Piras/John haven't even worked on cult for a while. Can also take the weight of wizard however if made before that antag.
