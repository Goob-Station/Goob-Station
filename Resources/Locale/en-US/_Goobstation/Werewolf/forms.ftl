base-form-description =
     An unmutated, classic werewolf form.
     This is the foundation of your transformations—powerful, resilient, and fearsome, but lacking any unnatural mutations.
     It represents the pure, primal essence of lycanthropy, with heightened senses, strength, and speed.

black-wolf-form-description =
     This form is twisted by a contagious curse.
     Anyone struck or touched while in this shape risks becoming infected themselves, spreading lycanthropy like a plague.
     Your claws and bite carry the power to turn victims into werewolves, making you a living vector of the beast’s curse.
