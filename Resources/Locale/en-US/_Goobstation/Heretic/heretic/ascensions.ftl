heretic-ascension-ash =
    The Watch is dead. The Nightwatcher burned with it, yet his fire burns evermore.
    I stand among the charred. The first of many, that which will shine brighter than all stars in the sky.
    FOR DUST THOU ART, AND UNTO DUST SHALT THOU RETURN. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-blade =
    I rip through chains of dust and light. The moon waxes here, among the chosen.
    The serpent decapitated. Its poison gone. Rent with crescent blades of silver.
    A storm of steel, am I, CHAMPION OF THE TORN AND PURE. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-lock =
    The Stewards... I hear them, now. My friends in the misted sky.
    A Labyrinth meant to contain us now broken. Solved. A guiding string led through.
    We cannot be contained. WE CANNOT BE LOCKED AWAY. WITNESS OUR ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-flesh =
    The heavens offered ideals and dreams. I desired more than that.
    More than blind promises of a better future. More than escapism from a dying world.
    The Marshal leads my army. THE SKY CAN BLEED, AND I WILL DRAIN IT OF ITS ESSENCE. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-void =
    The world falls into darkness. I stand in an empty plane; small flakes of ice fall from the sky.
    The Aristocrat stands before me, beckoning. We will play a waltz to the whispers of dying reality,
    as the world is destroyed before our eyes. The void will return all to nothing. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-rust =
    Let me tell you a story.
    There are hills ahead, draped in rust. Rust that rots your heat. Mouth parched, soul weak, your tongue begins to bleed.
    I am decay incarnate. INEVITABLE AS A DYING STAR; IMPASSIVE AS THE WATERS. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!
