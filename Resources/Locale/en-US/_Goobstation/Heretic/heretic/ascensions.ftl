heretic-ascension-ash =
    The Watch is dead. The Nightwatcher burned with it, yet his fire burns evermore,
    for the Nightwatcher brought forth the rite to mankind! His gaze continues, as now I am one with fire.
    FOR DUST THOU ART, AND UNTO DUST THOU SHALT RETURN. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-blade =
    I rip through chains of dust and light. The moon waxes here, among the chosen.
    The serpent decapitated. Its poison gone. Rent with crescent blades of silver.
    A storm of steel, am I, CHAMPION OF THE TORN AND FREE. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-lock =
    The Stewards guided me, and I guided them.
    My foes were the Locks and my blades were the Key!
    The Labyrinth will be Locked no more, and freedom will be ours! WITNESS OUR ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-flesh =
    The heavens offered ideals and dreams. I desired more than that -
    More than blind promises of a better future. More than escapism from a dying world.
    The Marshal leads my army. THE SKY CAN BLEED, AND I WILL DRAIN IT OF ITS ESSENCE. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-void =
    The world falls into darkness. I stand in an empty plane; small flakes of ice fall from the sky.
    The Aristocrat stands before me, beckoning. We will play a waltz to the whispers of dying reality,
    as the world is destroyed before our eyes. The void will return all to nothing. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-rust =
    Champion of rust. Corruptor of steel.
    Fear the dark, for the RUSTBRINGER has come!
    The Blacksmith forges ahead! Rusted Hills, CALL MY NAME! WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-bingle = bungle
