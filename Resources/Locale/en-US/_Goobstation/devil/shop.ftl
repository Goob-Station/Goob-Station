devil-pitchfork-desc = A stick used to punish the sinners. Deals a moderate amount of heat damage, but using your words will be more effective than this, when it comes to getting out of trouble.

devil-grip-desc = Channels what little power you have in this realm to stun whoever you touch. Can be upgraded to gain new effects. While in Archdevil form, forcefully steals the soul of anyone affected.

devil-grip-2-desc = The Devil's grip now applies a curse on the target that makes them sick and unable to eat until healed by a chaplain. This effect stacks with other upgrades.

devil-grip-3-desc = The Devil's grip now stuns for longer and slightly heals you. This effect stacks with other upgrades.

devil-grip-4-desc = The grip now steals the soul of the target, provided they are in a critical state.

devil-hellfire-desc = Shoots hellfire, dealing moderate heat damage and causing a small explosion. Mostly useful for causing chaos. Has a long cooldown. While in Archdevil form, the explosion causes a chain reaction.

devil-fire-immune-desc = Regains your total immunity to fire and high temperatures. Does not apply to lasers, as those did not quite exist in hell until recent times.

devil-hellstep-desc = Creates a trail of fire where your metaphysical tail meets the ground. Lasts a few seconds before sizzling out. While in Archdevil form, this creates lava instead.

devil-authority-desc = Exert your authority over lesser demons, bringing all currently alive slaughter demons to you. In the process, creates a large pool of blood and stuns any mortals nearby for a short duration. Works even if no demons are present.

devil-heresy-desc = Draws a heretical rune below your feet. The rune heals unholy damage over time, ever so slowly, so long as you stand on top of it.

devil-small-favor-desc = This lesser demon is itching to kill. Gives you the ability to temporarily bring a lesser demon to this realm to cause some carnage. Has a very long cooldown.

devil-big-favor-desc = Pull a few favors around and bring Bubblegum to you. He will charge at nearby lifeforms (avoiding you) and potentially cause a lot of damage before being promptly returned to Lavaland. Has a long cooldown.

devil-cheatdeath-desc = A one-time use action that fully regenerates any damage taken, including lost limbs. You can buy as many as you need, at the cost of delaying your ascension.
