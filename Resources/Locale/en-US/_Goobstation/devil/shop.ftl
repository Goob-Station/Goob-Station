devil-pitchfork-desc = A stick used to punish the sinners. Deals a moderate amount of heat damage, but using your words will be more effective than this, when it comes to getting out of trouble.

devil-grip-desc = Channels what little power you have in this realm to stun whoever you touch. Can be upgraded to gain new effects.

devil-hellfire-desc = Shoots hellfire, dealing moderate heat damage and causing a small explosion. Mostly useful for causing chaos. Has a long cooldown.

devil-fire-immune-desc = Regains your total immunity to fire and high temperatures. Does not apply to lasers, as those did not quite exist in hell until recent times.

devil-hellstep-desc = Creates a trail of fire where your metaphysical tail meets the ground. Lasts a few seconds before sizzling out.

devil-heresy-desc = Draws a heretical rune below your feet. The rune heals unholy damage over time, ever so slowly, so long as you stand on top of it.

devil-small-favor-desc = This lesser demon is itching to kill. Gives you the ability to temporarily bring a lesser demon to this realm to cause some carnage. Has a very long cooldown.

devil-big-favor-desc = Pull a few favors around and bring Bubblegum to you. He will charge at nearby lifeforms (avoiding you) and potentially cause a lot of damage before being promptly returned to Lavaland. Has a long cooldown.
