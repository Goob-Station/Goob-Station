reagent-name-stabilizing-agent = stabilizing agent
reagent-desc-stabilizing-agent = While not an explosive itself, it delays some pyrotechnic reactions until further heated, check the guidebook for specific temperatures!

reagent-name-smoke-powder = smoke powder
reagent-desc-smoke-powder = A weak chemical reaction that turns into a cloud of smoke, carrying all reagents within the container into the air. Without stabilizing agent this will immediately react. Must be heated to 374K to trigger if stabilized.

reagent-name-flash-powder = flash powder
reagent-desc-flash-powder = A chemical reaction that produces a blinding light, ineffective in smaller quantities. Without stabilizing agent this will immediately react. Must be heated to 374K to trigger if stabilized.
