reagent-name-stabilizing-agent = stabilizing agent
reagent-desc-stabilizing-agent = While not an explosive itself, it delays some pyrotechnic reactions until further heated, check the guidebook for specific temperatures!

reagent-name-smoke-powder = smoke powder
reagent-desc-smoke-powder = A weak chemical reaction that turns into a cloud of smoke, carrying all reagents within the container into the air, in stable form. Must be heated to 374K to trigger if stabilized.

reagent-name-flash-powder = flash powder
reagent-desc-flash-powder = A chemical reaction that produces a blinding light, ineffective in smaller quantities, in stable form. Must be heated to 374K to trigger if stabilized.

reagent-name-rdx = RDX
reagent-desc-rdx = A powerful explosive compound for military applications, WILL EXPLODE AT TEMPERATURES REQUIRED TO SYNTHESIZE unless a stabilizing agent is used.

reagent-name-stablerdx = stabilized RDX
reagent-desc-stablerdx = The explosive compound RDX in stable form, explodes when heated to 474K, but causes a stronger explosion immediately when mixed with equal parts Tazinide.
