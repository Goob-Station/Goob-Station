reagent-name-potash = potash
reagent-desc-potash = Potassium in a water-soluble form, originally created by soaking and boiling off wood ash. Used primarily as a fertilizer for plants.

reagent-name-saltpeter = saltpeter
reagent-desc-saltpeter = A potent source of nutrition for plants, but also used as an oxidizer in the creation of black powder.

reagent-name-blackpowder = black powder
reagent-desc-blackpowder = A primitive yet powerful explosive. Explodes when heated to 474K!

reagent-name-cryostylane = cryostylane
reagent-desc-cryostylane = A useful chemical, consumes oxygen or iodine to cool down the solution it's in.

reagent-name-potassium-sulfate = potassium sulfate
reagent-desc-potassium-sulfate = Potassium in a water-soluble form, providing both potassium and sulfur. Used primarily as a fertilizer for plants.

reagent-name-sodium-bicarbonate = sodium bicarbonate
reagent-desc-sodium-bicarbonate = A white, odorless, water-soluble salt that has a wide range of uses.  Also known as baking soda.

reagent-name-sodium-acetate = sodium acetate
reagent-desc-sodium-acetate = A white, odorless, water-soluble salt that results from mixing vinegar and baking soda.

reagent-name-methane = methane
reagent-desc-methane = A colorless, odorless, and flammable gas, being the simplest alkane. Do not breath.

reagent-name-methanol = methanol
reagent-desc-methanol = A colorless, odorless, and flammable liquid similar to ethanol however, it is extra toxic.
