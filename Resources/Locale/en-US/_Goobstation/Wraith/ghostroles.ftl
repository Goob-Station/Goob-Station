wraith-round-end-agent-name = Wraith

wraith-role-greeting =
    You are the [color=red]Wraith[/color], a vengeful spirit taken from the Void. Angry and confused, killing is the only thing you remember how to do.
    Your actions permit you to turn their own station against them. Possess objects, haunt the crew, and use their corpses as fuel for your soul to evolve into an even stronger spirit.
    Your weakness is [color=white]salt[/color]. Walking over any form of salt will [color=darkred]cause you to become corporeal and unable to use your powers[/color]. Being caught in such a state will surely lead to your swift demise.
    As a spirit, however, you are capable of surviving banishment once. It will leave you severely weakened, but will allow you to slowly regain your forces to enact your revenge.
    Fear the chaplain, as they are immune to most of your actions, and can even purge the effects of your powers from others. Absorbing their corpse would surely be satisfying...
