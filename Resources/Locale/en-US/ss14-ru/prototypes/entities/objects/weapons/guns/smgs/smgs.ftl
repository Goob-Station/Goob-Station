ent-BaseWeaponSubMachineGun = BaseSMG
    .desc = A rooty tooty point and shooty.
ent-WeaponSubMachineGunAtreides = Atreides
    .desc = A rare, compact machine pistol not often found in the Spinward sector. Being produced during the Corporate Wars and the design specs being long since lost to time, the Atreides excels at CQB due to its overwhelming firerate. Feeds from .35 Auto SMG magazines.
ent-WeaponSubMachineGunC20r = C-20R
    .desc = The right hand of those who fight under the three serpents. A one-handed, bullpup SMG from the Waffle Corporation that sacrifices accuracy for pure firerate. Feeds from .35 Auto SMG magazines.
ent-WeaponSubMachineGunDrozd = Drozd
    .desc = A bullpup SMG designed for the narrow and tight corridors common in station warfare. This law-enforcement model is select fire, but the Drozd's burst focused design throttles its full-auto performance massively. Feeds from .35 Auto SMG magazines.
ent-WeaponSubMachineGunWt550 = WT550
    .desc = A truly unique firearm, the WT550 loads from a proprietary top-mounted magazine parallel to the barrel. While the RPM isn't great, the small package and steady recoil make it fully usable one-handed. Feeds from top-mounted .35 Auto SMG magazines.
