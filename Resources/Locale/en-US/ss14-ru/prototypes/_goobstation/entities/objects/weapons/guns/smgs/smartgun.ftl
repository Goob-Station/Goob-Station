ent-WeaponSubMachineSmart = Abielle
    .desc = An experimental weapons platform that fires gyrojets—miniature rockets that communicate with the onboard targeting system to self-correct their flight paths. While sporting minimal recoil, the Abielle is prone to ridiculously wide spread when not homing due to the non-existent barrel. Feeds from .160 Smart magazines.
