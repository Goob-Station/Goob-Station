reagent-name-triclor = triclor
reagent-desc-triclor = Replicates itself upon contact with blood, and causes the metabolizer to constantly vomit, quickly emptying their stomachs and more. Has relatively low potency, and needs high doses to kill. Ineffective in trace amounts.

reagent-name-cyanide = cyanide
reagent-desc-cyanide = Easy to make toxin, and with deadly potential at average doses. However constant difficulties with breathing will quickly alert any potential victim.

reagent-name-anacea = anacea
reagent-desc-anacea = Quickly flushes most medicines from bloodstream, making it an invaluable ingredient of any poison mix. Strong anti-poison medicines can vastly slow down that process.

reagent-name-pendetide = pendetide
reagent-desc-pendetide = While mostly neutral, it amplifies any existing radiation damage. Additionally flushes medicines from bloodstream, making healing difficult.

reagent-name-aluite = aluite
reagent-desc-aluite = Non-reactive molecule that binds with other chemicals at low temperatures to transport them and boost their efficiency. Bursts when in bloodstream, with overdoses causing organ ruptures.

reagent-name-sarin = sarin
reagent-desc-sarin = A brutal neurotoxin that creates nasty caustic burns on contact with the skin. Poisonous when breathed in, and causes paralysis.

reagent-name-nevcottapowder = nevcotta powder
reagent-desc-nevcottapowder = A highly toxic powder created from grinding the bark of the nevcotta tree. Used in the creation of a classified chemical.
