    Click on the gold contacts with a multitool in hand to pulse their wire.
    Click on the wires with a pair of wirecutters in hand to cut/mend them.

    The lights at the top show the state of the machine, messing with wires will probably do stuff to them.
    Wire layouts are different each round, but consistent between machines of the same type.
