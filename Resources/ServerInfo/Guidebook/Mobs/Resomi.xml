  Resomi are a small avian-like species that hail from an icy world.

  Like most other non-human species, Resomi are capable of digesting raw meat and other uncooked animal proteins.

  As a result of the conditions of their home planet and ammonia-based blood, Resomi are immune to any cold damage and other effects.
  Consequently, they find temperatures that most other species find comfortable to be unbearably hot, finding themselves suffering starting at just 30Â°C.

  Along with their temperature tolerances, they take 30% more heat and brute damage.

  Due to their small size, they can fit in duffelbags. They also weigh less, making it harder for them to pull other species. Their unarmed attack deals Slash damage.
