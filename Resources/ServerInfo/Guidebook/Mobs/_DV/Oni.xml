  Large, horned people that come in a variety of colors. Their accuracy with guns is terrible, but their physical strength brings them a lot of boons both in and out of combat.

  - They take [color=#1e90ff]20% less Blunt, Slash, and Piercing damage[/color].
  - Does more damage in melee; 25% more Blunt, Slash, Piece, Stamina, and Structural damage.
  - Due to their big size, they can easily carry and pull any other species.
  - They heal brute damage by drinking booze, and are far harder to get drunk

  ## Drawbacks
  - Oni are unable to fire any weapons but shotguns with accuracy, with reports of bullets managing to fire even behind them

  - They are bigger than Humans, making them easier to hit.
  - Sources of holy damage are their bane, and will injure them greatly
