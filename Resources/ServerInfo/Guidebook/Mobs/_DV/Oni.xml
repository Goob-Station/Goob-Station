    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobOni" Caption=""/>
  </Box>

  Large, horned people that come in a variety of colors. Their physical strength brings them a lot of boons both in and out of combat. On the other hand, due to tradition and certain genetic issues, they cannot use any form or ranged weaponry.

  ## Diet
  - Just about anything. Can even eat many things raw.

  ## Benefits
  - Does more damage in melee; 20% more Blunt and 25% more Structural damage.
  - Due to their size, they can easily carry and drag around the rest of the species, while also dealing more stamina damage compared to the not so big ones.

  ## Drawbacks
  - Onis cannot use ANY form of ranged weaponry.
  - They are harder to carry and pull.
  - They are bigger than Humans, making them easier to hit.
