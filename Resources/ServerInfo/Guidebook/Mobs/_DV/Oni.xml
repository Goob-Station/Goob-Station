  Large, horned people that come in a variety of colors. Their accuracy with guns is terrible, but their physical strength brings them a lot of boons both in and out of combat.

  ## Benefits
  - They take 15% less Brute damage.
  - They do more damage in melee; 35% more Blunt and Asphyxiation, 20% more Slash and Piercing.
  - Due to their big size, they can easily carry and pull any other species.
  - Slightly more stamina than Humans.

  ## Drawbacks
  - They are too big and unwieldy, so they cannot use larger guns at all, and need to wield smaller ones.
  - They are harder to carry and pull.
  - They are bigger than Humans, making them easier to hit.
