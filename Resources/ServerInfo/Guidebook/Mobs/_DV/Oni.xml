  Large, horned people that come in a variety of colors. Their accuracy with guns is terrible, but their physical strength brings them a lot of boons both in and out of combat.

  ## Benefits
  - Does more damage in melee; 10% more Blunt, Slash, Piece, Stamina, and Structural damage.

  - They are harder to carry and pull.
  - They are bigger than Humans, making them easier to hit.
