  Rodentia are a race of humanoid beings resembling rodents. Resourceful, evasive, sneaky, but fragile.

  ## Diet

  - Can eat raw meat.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  ## Benefits

  - Uses their claws to do some Slashing and Blunt damage.
  - Can fit in duffelbags.

  ## Special

  - Can Rummage in disposal chutes, which can sometimes dig up food.
  - Can store small items in their cheeks. Having items in their mouth makes their speech unintelligible, and they will drop all items in their mouth if attacked, stunned, or shoved.
  - Can "sneak" underneath tables, but not doors.
  - Smaller than most other species.

  ## Drawbacks

  - Takes 30% more Blunt damage, and 15% more Slash and Piercing damage.
  - Always triggers mousetraps, regardless of whether or not they are wearing shoes.
  - Gets hungry 33% faster.
