  These are highly intellectual beings of unknown origin, possessing a quite unique physiology unlike previously seen. Their natural tongue is Marish.

  ##Physiology

  They appear to have a certain affinity to darkness, being rumored to be able to [color=#1e90ff]see in complete darkness[/color], unlike other species. Furthermore, they have been observed to [color=#1e90ff]sustain a telepathic link[/color] with other Shadowkin, being able to communicate through a hivemind.

  When exposed to fire, they seem to be less resistant than other species, [color=#ec3a3a]taking 50% more heat damage[/color], while being [color=Yellow]slightly more tolerant of cold than heated environments[/color].
  Regarding their anatomy, they possess large ears, [color=#1e90ff]very sensitive eyes[/color], and a tail for balance. It is also worth noting that their blood has a much higher concentration of iron in it when compared to other species. This biological trait significantly reduces their oxygen consumption and allows them to survive without it for much more prolonged periods of time.

  ## Other Characteristics

  Their unarmed attacks deal [color=#ec3a3a]5 slash[/color]. And their [color=#1e90ff]speed is slightly faster than humans[/color] due to their decreased bone density and superior agility.
  Another interesting quirk is their ability to survive in space for surprisingly longer than expected, having shown [color=#1e90ff]exceptional resilience to barotrauma[/color].
