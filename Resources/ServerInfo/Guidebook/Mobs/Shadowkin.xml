  These are highly intelectual beings of unknown origin, possessing a quite unique phisiology unlike previously seen. Their natural tongue is Marish.

  ##Phisiology

  They appear to have a certain affinity to darkness, being rumored to be able to [color=#1e90ff]see in complete darkness[/color] unlike other species. Furthermore, they have been observed to [color=#1e90ff]sustain a telepatic link[/color] with other shadowkin, being able to communicate through a hivemind.

  When exposed to fire, they seem to be less resistant than other species, [color=#ec3a3a]taking 50% more heat damage[/color], while being [color=Yellow]slightly more tolerant of cold than heated environments[/color].
  Regarding their anatomy, they possess large ears, eyes and a tail for balance. Its also worth noting their blood is black.

  ## Other Characteristics

  Their unarmed attacks deal [color=#ec3a3a]5 slash[/color]. And their [color=#1e90ff]speed is slightly faster than humans[/color] due to their decreased bone density and superior agility.
  Another interesting quirk is their ability to survive in space for surprisingly longer than expected, having shown [color=#1e90ff]exceptional resilience to barotrauma[/color].
