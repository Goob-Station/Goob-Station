  # Reptilians

  ## Fresh means healthy!

  Reptilians are capable of and are usually quite happy to eat things other species cannot, this includes things like raw meat, live animals, and even blood!

  ## Is it cold in here?

  Unlike other species, Reptilians are cold-blooded. This means they have no internal way of regulating their temperature and require external sources to assist.
  Luckily, Nanotrasen (and The Syndicate!) issue all Reptillian crewmembers their very own heating lamps, capable of keeping them warm when it would otherwise be too cold to work.

  These lamps take power cells and have three seperate modes: Low, Medium, and High.
  They can be worn on the belt, held in the hand, or placed inside a backpack. When inside a backpack, they do not function as well as they would otherwise.

  Due to this, they can also tolerate much higher temperatures than humans.
  But, they take [color=#ffa500]30% more Cold damage.[/color]

  ## Well, what about the tail?

  Reptillians can drag objects and people with their tail, allowing them to keep both of their hands free.
  A crafty lizard can use this in combat to their advantage. Maybe try dragging a teammate out of fire next time?

  Because of their claws, a Reptilians unarmed attack deals Slash damage instead of Blunt.
