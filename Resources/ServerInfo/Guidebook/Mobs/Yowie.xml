  Yowie are a once-thought urban myth, turned newly discovered mystical species of bipedal hairy creature.
  Their body is larger than most other species in stature, with the downside of them [color=#AAFF00]not being able to fit into most Nanotrasen external wear or shoes[/color], or [color=#AAFF00] being able to be carried by others[/color].
  Their fur also allows them to take [color=#baf2ef]less cold damage[/color] but suffer [color=#ec3a3a]slightly more heat damage[/color].
  
  
  Their stature makes their unarmed punch deal [color=#ec3a3a]2x the damage[/color] of a human punch

  From discussions had between our species, it seems historically they were living beside humanity during its existence on Earth in parts of Australia, lending them to develop a thick australian accent with slang included.
  They seem to have spent most of their time experimenting with some of the most dangerous and experimental drugs, and on review, they've built up a bigger tolerance to most chemicals.
