  Tajaran are a species of omnivorous, bipedal humanoids with features that bear a strong resemblance to terran felines.
  They have a keen sixth sense to landing and [color=#1e90ff]take 80% less damage from falling or high speed impacts.[/color]
  They will also be slowed down less when injured

  They will slash with their claws instead of using their fists, dealing [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage.

  They are also capable of eating live rats, which will allow them to cough up a disgusting hairball.
  Be careful when touching them, as they can [color=#ffa500]cause you to throwup when held.[/color]
  Tajaran will use this to their advantage to gross out adversaries
