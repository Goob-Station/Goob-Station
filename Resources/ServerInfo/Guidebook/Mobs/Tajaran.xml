  Tajara are a species of omnivorous, bipedal humanoids with features strongly resembling Terran felines.
  Their most distinguishing traits include a layer of fur, large ears atop their heads, and a tail that aids in balance.
  They hail from the icy moon of [color=turquoise]Ahdomai[/color], only relatively recently making their debut on the galactic stage.
  Originally a clan-centric society, they endured centuries of dictatorial rule.
  Following a civil war, their government fractured, and power returned to the clans, where it remains to this day.

  ## Mechanics

  Due to their [color=yellow]small stature[/color], Tajara [color=#ec3a3a]take 15% more Brute damage[/color], but they can also [color=#1e90ff]fit into duffel bags[/color].
  
  They use their claws for unarmed attacks, dealing [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage.

  Thanks to their innate agility, they [color=#1e90ff]take reduced damage from impacts or falls[/color], and their soft feet allow them to [color=#1e90ff]walk shoeless without making noise[/color].

  They can also eat live mice, which lets them cough up a hairball that [color=#1e90ff]cleanses their bloodstream[/color].
  However, being [color=#ec3a3a]extremely disgusting[/color], the hairball can cause vomiting if held by others.
