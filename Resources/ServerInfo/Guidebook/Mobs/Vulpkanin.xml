  Vulpkanin are canine-like humanoids, sporting distinct ears and tails. They see the world in reds and greens,
  deal [color=#ec3a3a]blunt [/color]and [color=#ec3a3a]slash [/color] damage with their claws, and their fur
  insulates them from environment temperature at the cost of making them 15% more vulnerable to Heat damage.
