  # Revolutionaries

  Revolutionaries are conversion antagonists sponsored by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate[/color] who are tasked with taking control of the station. They have no fancy gimmicks or cheap tricks, they only have a cause and strength in numbers.

  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevolutionaryManifesto" Caption="Revolutionary Manifesto"/>
</Box>

  [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color] are chosen at the start of the shift and are tasked with taking over the station by killing, exiling or cuffing all of the Command staff. Head Revolutionaries will be given a [color=#a4885c]Revolutionary Manifesto[/color] to aid them.
  Your objective is [bold]not to destroy the station[/bold], but [italic]to take it over[/italic], so try to minimize damage where possible.

  [bold]The revolution will fail[/bold] if all of the [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] die, and all [color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] will de-convert if this happens.

  ## Headrevs & Conversion
  [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] are chosen at the start of the shift and begin with a [color=cyan]flash[/color] and a pair of [color=cyan]sunglasses[/color].

  You can convert crew members by using a [color=#a4885c]Revolutionary Manifesto[/color] on them.

  Beware! A [color=#a4885c]MindShield Implant[/color] will prevent the implanted person from being converted into a revolutionary. Assume all of [color=#a4885c]Security[/color] and [color=#a4885c]Command[/color] are implanted already.

  Another obstacle in your way are those pesky [color=cyan]mindshield implanters[/color]. These will:
  - Prevent the implanted person from being converted into a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color]
  - De-convert Revolutionaries, and will make them no longer loyal to your cause
  - [bold]Visibly be destroyed upon being implanted into a [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold], giving you away

  Assume all of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] and [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] are implanted with mindshields already, [bold]however they can be removed using an empty implanter, obtainable from the Medical department's MedFab.[/bold]



  ## Revolutionary
  A [color=#ff0000]Revolutionary[/color] is the result of being converted by a [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color]. Revolutionaries are underlings of the Head Revolutionaries and should follow orders given by them and prioritize their well-being over anything else, because if they die, you will lose.
  Keep in mind that you can't convert others as a regular revolutionary, only your boss can do that.
