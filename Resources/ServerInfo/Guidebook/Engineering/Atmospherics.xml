	# Atmospherics
	Atmospherics is the engineering subdepartment responsible for maintaining the station's atmosphere, and ensuring that it is safe and breathable for the crew.

	Atmospherics is run by Atmospheric Technicians, who are overseen by the Chief Engineer.

	## Responsibilities
	Generally, you'll be responding to [textlink="atmospheric upsets" link="AtmosphericUpsets"] throughout the station.
	These can range from minor leaks to full-on [textlink="fires" link="Fires"] or [textlink="spacing" link="Spacing"] incidents.

	People from other departments may also request [textlink="canned gasses" link="GasCanisters"] for their department duties, such as [textlink="plasma" link="Gasses"] for the [textlink="Research Department" link="Science"] or [textlink="carbon dioxide" link="Gasses"] for [textlink="Chemistry" link="Chemist"].

	When there's no work to do, you may be expected to help regular Station Engineers with their tasks, and mentor new Station Engineers and Atmospheric Technicians.
	In your downtime, you may seek to improve the station by setting up rooms with different atmospheres for [textlink="Voxes" link="Vox"] and other species, or by setting up production of [textlink="exotic gasses" link="Gasses"] for the station's needs.
	
	## Reference Sheet
	- Standard atmospheric mix is [color=#a4885c]78% N2 and 22% O2 at 101.24kPa.[/color]
	- Gas obeys real math. You can use the equation:

	</Box>
	<Box>
		([color=#a4885c]Pressure kPa * Volume L = Moles * R * Temperature K[/color])
	</Box> to derive information you might need to know about a gas. R is approximately 8.31446.
