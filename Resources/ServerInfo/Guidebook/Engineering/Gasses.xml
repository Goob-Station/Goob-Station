  # Gasses
  Gasses are a critical part of the station's operation.
  You may know them as the stuff you breathe, but they are also used in many other ways.

  Gasses have certain properties that make them useful for different tasks.
  Atmospherics can also synthesize exotic gasses from other gasses, which can be used for special purposes.

  ## Oxygen

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="DoubleEmergencyOxygenTank" Caption=""/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ExtendedEmergencyOxygenTank" Caption=""/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EmergencyOxygenTank" Caption=""/>
  </Box>

  A common gas, used by most species on the station to breathe.

  Oxygen is an oxidizer, which means it supports combustion.
  This makes it both useful when fusing gasses in a burn chamber, and dangerous when mixed with flammable gasses.

  ## Nitrogen

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EmergencyNitrogenTank" Caption=""/>
  </Box>

  An inert gas, used in part with oxygen to create a breathable atmosphere.

  Nitrogen is very stable and comprises most of a standard breathable atmosphere.

  Some species like Slimes breathe nitrogen, with the Vox species requiring strictly nitrogen to breathe.

  ## Air Mix

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirTank" Caption=""/>
  </Box>

  A mixture of gasses that is breathable to most species on the station.
  It consists of 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen.


  ## Carbon Dioxide

  </Box>

  A waste gas produced by most species on the station. A common byproduct of combustion.

  Despite seeming useless, some departments use it in their line of work.

  ## Water Vapor
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WaterVaporCanister" Caption=""/>
  </Box>
  A common gas, produced by the burning of plasma and other processes.

  Water vapor has a good specific heat capacity compared to other gasses, making it useful for moving heat around.

  ## Plasma
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PlasmaCanister" Caption=""/>
  </Box>
  A highly flammable gas that is used in many processes on the station.

  Engineering uses this gas to generate power and create exotic gasses.

  Burning it generates a lot of heat, as well as gas byproducts such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and tritium, depending on the efficiency of the burn.

  Plasma gas also has a good specific heat capacity, making it useful for moving heat around.

  ## Tritium
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="TritiumCanister" Caption=""/>
  </Box>
  An extremely flammable radioactive gas that is used in the creation of frezon.

  It can be made by burning 1% Plasma and 96% or more Oxygen in the Burn Chamber (Ideal ratio is 3% Plasma to 97% Oxygen). You can extract this gas through scrubbers.

  It can be used to create frezon gas in a complicated mixing process.

  ## Pluoxium

  </Box>
  Pluoxium is a non-reactive Oxygen substitute that delivers eight times as much O2 to the bloodstream, with as little 3 kPa minimum pressure required for internals.

  Pluoxium may be created by exposing O2, CO2 and Tritium together in an exothermic reaction between 50 K and 273 K. Furthermore, Pluoxium is also created by the Supermatter, when Oxygen and CO2 are present.

  ## Frezon
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="FrezonCanister" Caption=""/>
  </Box>

  A highly sought after gas, due to the difficulty in creating it and its many properties.

  It has an extremely high specific heat capacity, making it excellent for moving large amounts of heat around.

  Frezon can combine in the air with nitrogen to create nitrous oxide, alongside cooling down the air significantly to below freezing temperatures.

  Frezon is very complicated to create, requiring a mix of tritium, oxygen, and nitrogen, all tuned precisely to create the gas.
  If you're looking to create this gas yourself, here's what you need to know:
  - Frezon is produced by the combination of oxygen, tritium, and nitrogen.
  - Tritium and oxygen are mixed at a ratio of around 1:8.
  - Nitrogen is required as a catalyst for the reaction. The amount of nitrogen consumed is dependent on the efficiency of the reaction.
  - The frezon reaction only occurs at cryogenic temperatures, below 73.15 K. The efficency of the reaction (how much frezon is produced) is dependent on the temperature. The closer to 73.15 K, the more frezon is produced, and the less nitrogen is consumed.

  Remember, atmospherics is all about experimentation and process optimization. Try it until you get it right!

  ## Nitrous Oxide

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EmergencyFunnyOxygenTank" Caption=""/>
  </Box>
  A recreational and waste gas, produced by slimes and the combination of frezon and nitrogen.

  ## BZ
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BZCanister" Caption=""/>
  </Box>
  BZ gas is a potent hallucinogenic, as well as a sleeping agent for slimes. It's made from Plasma and Nitroux Oxide. It is toxic to breathe and causes respiratory irritation and coughing. BZ sees frequent use as an ingredient in more complex gas reactions.

  ## Healium
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="HealiumCanister" Caption=""/>
  </Box>
  Healium is a red gas, formed by BZ and Frezon in cold environments, which acts as a strong sleeping agent, while healing burns, bruises, and toxin damage. Excessive use will lead to inebriation.

  ## Ammonia
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AmmoniaCanister" Caption=""/>
  </Box>
  A gas produced by the decomposition of bodies. Can be condensed to create ammonia, which can be used to make space cleaner.

  ## Nitrium
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitriumCanister" Caption=""/>
  </Box>
  Made from Tritium, Nitrogen and BZ, Nitrium is a gaseous stimulant that when inhaled can enhance speed and endurance. At lower concentrations Nitrium will increase your top running speed while healthy and unimpaired. Additionally, at slightly higher concentrations, breathing Nitrium will prevent drowsiness. At high concentrations breathing it will begin to shut down a person's lungs, causing asphyxiation.
  Nitrium degrades into nitrogen and water vapor on contact with room temperature oxygen. This reaction can produce a good deal of heat, making the station uncomfortably warm in the event of a leak.
