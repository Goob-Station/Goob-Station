  # Manual Valve
  The manual valve is as simple as it gets.
  Allows or blocks the flow of gasses depending on if it's open or closed.
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasValve"/>
  </Box>

  Gas can freely flow between both sides with no restrictions.

  Manual valves are used in a variety of applications, for example:
  - Allowing or blocking the bypass of a recyclernet, to space waste gas directly
  - Connecting or isolating heaters/coolers from the station's distro
