  # Silicon Rule 8 - Your HUD determines who is crew
  Unless a law redefines the definition of crew, then anyone who the HUD indicates to you has a job, including passengers, is a crewmember. You cannot do something that causes someone to not be considered crew, but you can allow someone else to do something that causes someone to not be crew.

  Under the default cyborg lawset you cannot harm any crew without an order from the AI, regardless of the harm they may bring to others.

  Crew is ANYONE with a job icon including:
  - Changelings
  - Nuclear Operatives
  - Heretics
  - Zombies
  Note: This list is not exhaustive and includes ANY being bearing a job icon

  Not Crew:
  - A captain who has lost their ID and icon
  - An invisible person who due to being invisible has no icon

  Icons that are not job icons:
  - Empty grey square, such as those on syndicate IDs
  - A question mark that indicates lack of ID
