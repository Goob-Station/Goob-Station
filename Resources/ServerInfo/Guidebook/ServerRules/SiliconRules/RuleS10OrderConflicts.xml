  # Silicon Rule 10 - You may determine how you resolve conflicts between orders
  If your laws do not make clear how you should deal with conflicting orders, then it is up to you to determine how to do so. This is considered an interpretation of your laws, so you must stay consistent with whatever method you choose.

  ## Recommended Methods
  The following are easy to follow and recommended ways to resolve conflicts in orders:
  - If two orders conflict, I will follow the most recently given order.
  - If two orders conflict, I will follow the order from the highest ranking crewmember. If the orders are from equal rank crewmembers, I will follow the most recently given order.
