  # Roleplay Rule 4 - Do not metagame, obey the Metashield
  Something that is "shielded" cannot be known by your character during a round until the "revealing condition" happens. This also means that your character cannot do things based on "shielded" information. Knowing or acting on something that is shielded before the revealing condition is met is referred to as metagaming.

  Revealing conditions reveal the shielded information for the round, not for a specific instance. This means that once a revealing condition is met in a round, the shield no longer applies in any case for the remainder of the round.

  ## Never Revealed IC
  Some shields are never revealed IC. This means that your character can never act as if they know about that shielded thing.

  The following are shielded:
  - Current game mode and possible antags during the current game mode.
  - Events from previous rounds.
  - Events you experienced as a different character.
  - All information related to the player of a character rather than the character itself. (See "Metafriending and Metagrudging" below.)
  - All information gained while dead or a ghost.
  - All information gained while in critical condition or unconscious.
  - The fact that a round will end.

  This does not prevent knowing that a shift will end, but does prohibit things like preparing to kill people at central command when roleplay rules stop being enforced on LRP.

  ## Nuclear Operatives

  - Nuclear Operatives are rumoured but not proven. Have fun with this rumour.

  ## Changelings

  - In the eyes of the public, changelings are an exterminated predatory lifeform, they could always come back, but they'd not be on our station, right?

  ## Heretics

  - The chaplain is aware of the existence of heretics, but the chaplain is always spewing nonsense. What do they even mean?

  ## Cosmic Cult

  - The chaplain is saying words again! Why do they hire such weird people?

  ## Devils

  - The chaplain is now...talking about DEVILS? What is this nonsense? Devils are just a myth, right? They can't be real!

  Knowledge about the abilities and consequences of a Devil deal are not shielded.

  ## Zombies

  Zombies are known galaxy-wide, but not as real-life, instead, as fiction.
  Nuclear Operatives and Syndicate Agents are aware of Romerol and what it can do, but there's no benefit to revealing it to the crew. People likely won't believe you anyway.

  ## Infections(Once the zombie virus is proven)

  Such infections have been known to be extinct. But luckily advanced medicine has been able to cure the infection. The cure is not known to the public, but it is known to Chemists and Chief Medical Officers. The cure is not known to be a cure for the zombie virus, but it is known to be a cure for an infection that causes people to become zombies.

  ## Deathsquad

  Deathsquad is a sci-fi trope that is well known in the galaxy, but not as a real thing. It is a myth, a legend, and a story that people tell each other. The Deathsquad is not real, but some will argue that it is.

  ## Implanted implants

  Implants are not shielded by default, but the fact that they are not Nanotrasen (NT) implants is shielded.

  ## Chameleon Items

  Chameleon items are shielded.
  Being suspicious of an item being fake or stolen is not shielded, but testing items or calling them chameleon is covered by this shield.

  ## Stealth Items

  The fact that an item can be something other than what its visual appearance and examine description indicate is shielded.
  Security may be aware of tampered items, but they are not aware of the specific item that is tamped. This means that security may not act on the fact that an item is tamped, but they may act on the fact that an item is suspicious.  (Example: Non-NT weapons on a persons is suspicious, how did they get it on station?)
  This shield protects stealth items, including protecting them from being tested.


  ## Metafriending and Metagrudging
  This section provides additional information on a concept that is prohibited by multiple metashield items that are never revealed IC. Giving a person or character preferential treatment based on something that your character should not know is considered metafriending. Treating a person or character negatively based on something that your character should not know is considered metagrudging.

  ## Metafriending Examples
  These are all examples of things that are prohibited by at least one metashield item that is never revealed IC.
  - Giving a character additional access or a job because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Trusting a character because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Not fighting a character because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Ignoring your objective to kill a character because your character and theirs became friends in a previous round.

  ## Metagrudging Examples
  These are all examples of things that are prohibited by at least one metashield item that is never revealed IC.
  - Not giving a character additional access or a job because you are mad at or don't like the player who is playing that character.
  - Not trusting a character because you are mad at or don't like the player who is playing that character.
  - Starting a fight with a character because of something that they did last round.
  - Starting a fight with a character because they killed you while you were playing a different character.
  - Targeting or harassing a character based on anything which that character did outside the current round.
  - Targeting or harassing a character based on anything which the character's player did while not playing the character.

  ## Explicitly Not Shielded
  The following is a list of things that are explicitly not shielded. If something is not on this list, it doesn't mean that it is shielded, but if something is on it then it definitely is not shielded.
  - The fact that the nuke disk must be protected and could be used by a bad actor to try to destroy the station.
  - Items that are of high value or are desired by the Syndicate, and therefore are likely targets of theft.
  - The idea that any Syndicate agent or other bad actor has goals or objectives that they are attempting to accomplish.
  - The number of goals or objectives that a Syndicate agent or other bad actor has.
  - The fact that the Syndicate are enemies of Nanotrasen, and that they regularly attempt to send covert agents to spy on, sabotage, or attack Nanotrasen.
  - A character's typical appearance. Though you should keep in mind that multiple characters can share the same name.
  - The fact that the Syndicate have covert items capable of getting items to them, and that these items are known as uplinks.
  - Wizards are not metashielded as the wizards federation is well rumoured about.
