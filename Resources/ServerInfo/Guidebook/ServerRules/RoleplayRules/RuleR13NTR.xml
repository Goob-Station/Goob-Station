  # Roleplay Rule 17 - Nanotrasen Representative Rules
    - You are to represent NT, send reports back to them on the stations' situation, inform the heads of anything CentCom orders them to do. Stay on task and avoid doing anything else apart from this.
    - You are to also guide the Station Heads, along with the Blueshield if needed. If you can't provide an answer, try ahelping for one.
    - Do not abuse your extra access for malicious reasons. Only use it if you must.
    - Use common sense and remember that you are also held up to a high standard of play. Failure to do so will lead to a roleban from command or gameban from the server entirely.
