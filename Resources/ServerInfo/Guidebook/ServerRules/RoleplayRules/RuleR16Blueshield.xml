  # Roleplay Rule 16 - Blueshield Rules
    - You are to protect the Station Heads and Central Command VIPs from danger. You are not a Security Officer with extra access, so do not abandon your duties.
    - You are held up to a higher standard of play as command and Security. Take your job seriously, and do it right.
    - You answer to the Central Command only. Follow directives to your best ability.
    - Do not abuse your role, and use common sense. If you have questions or concerns, ahelp them for the Admins to answer or try asking in the Discord. Failure to do so can lead to a roleban from command or gameban.
    - Do not make yourself Captain or any other command job. If you want to be Captain, instead choose that role while in the lobby.
