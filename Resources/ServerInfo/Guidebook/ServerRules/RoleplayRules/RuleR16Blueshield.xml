  # Roleplay Rule 16 - Blueshield Rules
    - You are to protect the Station Heads and Central Command VIPs from danger. You are not a Security Officer with all-access, so do not abandon your duties. If you are dismissed and no longer needed, you are able to instead help with security work until further notice.
    - You are held up to a higher standard of play as command and the Nanotrasen Representative is. Take your job seriously, and do it right.
    - Your higher up is the Nanotrasen Representative. If you need guidance, ask them for help.
    - Do not abuse your role, and use common sense. If you have questions or concerns, ahelp them for the Admins to answer or try asking in the Discord. Failure to do so can lead to a roleban from command or gameban.
    - Do not make yourself Captain or any other command job. If you want to be Captain, instead choose that role while in the lobby.
