  # Roleplay Rule 18 - Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job.
  Requesting job changes is not prohibited by this rule. This rule is loosened if the station is understaffed or if there is a significant threat to you.

  If you start with the item, it is fine for you to keep. For example, the Janitor starting with galoshes bypasses this rule as it is actually needed for their job.
  Basic tools are explicitly not powergaming, but don't go hoarding them, and if you know there's already a couple of sets in your department you don't need more.

  ## MRP Amendment
  This is enforced more strictly on MRP.

  ## Examples
  Acceptable:
  - Grabbing a gun from the armory because there is a threat or the station is on red alert.
  - Grabbing cuffs for your disabler.
  - As a passenger, building a maintenance bar.
  - As an engineer, reinforcing substations.
  - As an engineer, increasing the security of airlocks.
  - As an atmospherics technician, improving atmospheric systems.
  - As a passenger, fighting nuclear operatives.
  - As a passenger, fighting or preparing to defend yourself from someone who has been trying to kill you.
  - As a crewmember on a station with no engineering department, you complete engineering tasks.

  Prohibited:
  - Grabbing insulative gloves as a Medical Doctor for no real reason.
  - Grabbing a gun from the armory despite there being no current threat or reason.
  - Manufacturing weapons, bombs, or death poisons before you know of any reason you would need them.
  - Pre-emptively hide antagonist objectives or pre-emptively secure them with higher security then normally required.
  - Manufacturing or prepare things for the "end of the round" when the shuttle docks with Central Command.
  - As the Captain, giving the HoS your extra ID roundstart for "safe keeping"
