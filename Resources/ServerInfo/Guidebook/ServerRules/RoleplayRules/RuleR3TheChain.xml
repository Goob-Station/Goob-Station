  # Roleplay Rule 3 - Chain of command and security are important.

  If you're in the Chain of Command or in Security, you're expected to put in the effort and do your job as a departmental leader.

  If you're not in the Chain of Command, your department head is your boss and they can fire you. Security officers can arrest you for stealing or breaking into places. Demotions and short brig sentences for actions that would get you fired or arrested in real life are roleplay opportunities.

  ## precedents

  - The internal chain of command for security is Head of Security > Warden > Officers & Detective.
  - Security are expected by default to follow the orders of their superiors, especially when determining the punishment of those you apprehend. When determining severe punishments such as permanent incarceration or execution, make an effort to contact a superior if the situation permits it.
  - You are allowed to disobey a superior's order with appropriate in-character roleplay reasoning. Complete disregard for the chain of command as a member of security is not tolerated.
