  # Roleplay Rule 22 - Devils

  As a Devil, you are not allowed to interfere with the station, nor it's crew unless it stands to benefit you or a deal.

  Devils are creatures bound by the power of their oaths.
  They cannot knowingly and/or willingly violate the terms of Contracts/Oaths/Promises they make.

  Likewise, this power extends to individuals who make deals with them.
  You cannot knowingly and/or willingly violate the terms of Contracts/Oaths/Promises you make with a Devil.

  ## Acceptable Examples Include:
  - Offering to steal the captains jetpack for a Traitor in exchange for their soul, stealing the jetpack, and receiving a soul.
  - Offering to help someone settle a grudge with an enemy by stealing their shoes in exchange for something.
  - Offering to weld the doors to security shut so a Traitor can complete their objectives without being obstructed, in exchange for their soul.

  ## Unacceptable Examples Include:
  - Offering to complete a task for someone in exchange for their soul, taking their soul, and then doing nothing.
  - Breaking into the Captains office with your teleportation ability, then stealing everything from their locker for the fun of it.
  - Offering to sell your soul to the Devil in exchange them helping you with something, and then not giving them your soul when prompted.

  ## Notes:
  - If all involved parties agree, a Contract/Oath/Promise may be rendered void and broken freely.
  - Failing to fulfill a deal due to external reasoning is not the same as willingly breaking it. One is in-character, the other is out-of-character.
  - The words of a deal is what must be followed, not the spirit.
