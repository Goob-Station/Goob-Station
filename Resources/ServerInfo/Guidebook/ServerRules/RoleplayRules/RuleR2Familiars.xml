  # Roleplay Rule 2 - Familiars must obey their master
  Familiars are considered non-antagonists, but have instructions to obey someone. They must obey this person even if it causes them to violate Roleplay Rules or die. You are only a familiar if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a familiar. You are only the familiar of the person the game tells you. If your master dies, you can continue to attempt to fulfill orders given to you before they died. You can defend your master without an explicit order to, but must obey your master if they order you to not defend them. Orders do not override Core Rules.

  Masters giving orders that violate Roleplay Rules are the ones that will be held responsible for the rule violations. You can ahelp masters who you believe are breaking rules with an order.
