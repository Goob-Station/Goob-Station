  # Roleplay Rule 9 - Play as a coherent, believable character.

  Space Station 13 is a space opera parody. You're on a space station that employs clowns and mimes, has cargo gorillas, people are eating deep fried clothes and sometimes there's a dozen Captains. Your character should fit within this game world.

  Childish or infantile characters should be avoided, whilst silly characters should be roleplayed properly. There's a good chance your character still wants to have a job at the end of the day, so you should probably act like it.

  ## Precedents

  RPR 11 applies to character design and roleplay, drug-addled assistants, kleptomaniac mafia cargo technicians and somewhat negligent station engineers are all a core part of the tone of the setting, but playing these stereotypes continually is detrimental to the experience of the setting – if you’re screaming about your meth factory over common enough times to make a habit of it, it’s probably time to stop.
