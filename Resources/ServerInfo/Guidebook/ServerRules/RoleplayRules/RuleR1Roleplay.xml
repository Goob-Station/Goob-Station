  # Roleplay Rule 1 - LRP and MRP have different levels of intended roleplay

  The purpose of roleplay servers are to provide a higher quality environment for roleplay. The roleplay rules are intended to promote more interactions between players so more roleplay moments can happen. They are not exhaustive, and admins have a very broad discretion to intervene where behaviours or actions could, if left ignored, contribute to a lower roleplay environment.

  What differentiates LRP and MRP on Goob is generally community driven and not strictly defined. However, please note the following:

  - LRP is intended to be a more casual roleplay environment, where players are not expected to follow the same level of immersion or character consistency as in MRP.
  - MRP is intended to be a more immersive roleplay environment, where players are expected to follow a higher level of immersion and character consistency.
  - The average round time on LRP is generally shorter than on MRP, and players are expected to be more flexible with their characters and roleplay.
  - A character on LRP is not expected to be as fleshed out or consistent as a character on MRP, and players are encouraged to have fun and experiment with their characters.
  - antagonists on LRP are not expected to follow the same level of immersion or character consistency as on MRP, and players are encouraged to have fun and experiment with their antagonists.
  - On MRP antagonists are expected to follow a higher level of immersion and character consistency, and players are encouraged to have fun and experiment with their antagonists within the boundaries of the roleplay rules.
