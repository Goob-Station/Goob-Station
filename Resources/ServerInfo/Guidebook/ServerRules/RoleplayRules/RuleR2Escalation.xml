  # Roleplay Rule 2 - Escalation and roleplay.
  Modified standard escalation applies to instances of player conflict. Players may escalate as per standard escalation policy on LRP/MRP where they have legitimate in character reason to do so.

  Players acting without legitimate IC reasoning (for example: randomly or unnecessarily attempting to steal items from departments or other people) void the right to escalate to lethal self-defence if it is employed reasonably by the wronged party.

  - Higher effort in roleplay allows you to escalate more.
  - If you are attacked, you may defend yourself with lethal force if you have a legitimate IC reason to do so.
  - MRP players are expected to follow a higher level of immersion and character consistency, and players are encouraged to have fun and experiment with their antagonists within the boundaries of the roleplay rules.
