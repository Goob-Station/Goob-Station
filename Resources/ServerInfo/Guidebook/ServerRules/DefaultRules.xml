# Slon Station Rules

  Just use common sense and don't be a dick. You'd get banned if people consistently complain about your actions. Also, admins may do whatever they see fitting to you.

  Play your role. Believably—basic interactions and teamwork are expected. No "Adolf Hitler" IC names, it's funny one time but no more.

  Fulfill basic role duties (e.g., Engineers fix power, Doctors heal people). Avoid neglect (e.g., no going to the bar roundstart as a Salvager while the station lacks resources).

  Non-antags should not murder, sabotage, or excessively harm others. Antags have free rein, but try to be creative, repeating the same boring rampage gets old fast.

  Main server language is English, but players can speak any language if it doesn’t hinder basic communication with other players and admins.

  There are explicitly NO metashields, no metacomming rule (please don't use it to cheat in fair combat, it's lame, but we can't moderate it anyway) and no hate speech (slur) rule.

By accepting these rules, you consent to the server redialing you to other servers in our network.
