# Goobstation Rules

  - Space Station 14 is not like most games. Many rules are designed to require roleplay, and not all rules are intuitive. Please take the time to read and understand the rules before you play so that you aren't surprised. Some of our rules are zero tolerance rules, meaning that a violation will result in an indefinite ban without any warning. Game admins will treat you as if you have read the rules, even if you have not.

  - Roleplay is king, and admins can disregard other rules to this end should it prove beneficial for the experience of the shift. Admins may choose to intervene in rounds when it is in the best interest of the playerbase.

## IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES

  Additional rules made for our roleplay servers (Sigma/Alpha/Beta(LRP) & Regalis/Aurum(MRP)) If roleplaying isn't your style, every other server still abides by only the Main Rules.

  You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon. For players who are silicons, these Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override core rules.

  - [textlink="1. Your silicon laws are rules" link="RuleS1"]

  - [textlink="10. You may determine how you resolve conflicts between orders" link="RuleS10"]

By accepting these rules, you consent to the server redialing you to other servers in our network.
