  # Core Rule 11 - Bigotry is not allowed.

  Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, disability, orientation or the like is not tolerated.

  ## Precedents

  - This rule applies to ALL OOC bigotry, even when expressed in IC. There is no racism in 2565, just species-ism: there is no homophobia, just xenophiliaphobia, etc.
  - Admins are encouraged to use rule 1 to deal with instances where """IC""" bigotry is excessive or designed as a mask for OOC bigotry.
  - Context is important, but somebody being an out and proud bigot, nazi, or white supremacist also counts as context. Somebody who makes it known they are bigoted towards PoCs playing a PoC character that starts checking stereotype boxes isn't going to fool us.
  - Obvious or common real life replacements of offensive words or slurs used in IC are not allowed. For example, you may not insult a lizard by calling them the L- and ending with er as an N-word derivative will result in your permanent removal. Be creative.
