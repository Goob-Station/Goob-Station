  # Core Rule 3 - This is a sandbox roleplaying server

  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  Keep IC out of OOC, and OOC out of IC. Your words and actions ingame should be distinguishable as an in-universe character, and not as a person playing a game. Playstyles that disregard all opportunities for engagement and roleplay can be met with administrative action. There is an exception for OOC in IC where terms like 'clickdrag X to Y, or look for the tab' is used to help a player.

  ## Precedents
  - References to the current round, even if vague, are still considered being IC in OOC.
  - Disruptive fighting with your friends in public spaces (sometimes called "chicken fights" or "Family Guy chicken fighting") is against the rules if done so without valid IC reason. If you do want to fight your friends for no real IC reason, keep it out of the public or utilise purpose-built areas such as rage cages, boxing rings or holodeck combat sims to make it RP-friendly.
  - Make a minimum effort to have your name fit in a setting involving a wacky space station in the future.
  - Honorifics and nicknames are allowed as long as only one additive is used at a time, i.e "James Williams Jr." or "James "One-Eye" Williams". Excessively OOC names are disallowed, and are defined as names which are intentionally hard to read/spell, references to in-game mechanics or OOC terminology, historical/famous/media, and any form of nonsensical or low-effort name. Clowns, mimes, silicons, wizards, and nuke ops have significantly more leeway in choosing their names, within reason.
