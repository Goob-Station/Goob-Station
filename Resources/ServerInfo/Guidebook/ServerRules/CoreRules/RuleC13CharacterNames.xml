  # Core Rule 13 - Use realistic character names, and do not use names of famous people 
  - No names of people or characters fictional or real from our world. You are not slick if you switch a few letters around.
  - No titles/honorifics (Exceptions being generational titles like "Jr" or "I", "II", "III", etc), nicknames, or shortenings. Use proper capitalization (e.g. NOT J Hoffman or jaiden mallow).
  - Must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
  - Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names. See examples below. 
  - Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through the forums, not by refusing to comply with an admin
  - Species have naming conventions that are part of their in-universe culture. These may be subverted if they have sufficient in-character reasoning and effort to explain their non-standard name. Non-standard names are held to higher scrutiny and you may be questioned on why your name breaks these conventions.

  # Naming Conventions:
  Clowns and mimes are exempt from the prohibition on titles/honorifics and have loosened restrictions on low-effort and implausible names.

  ## Clarification on "Meta" Names
  Meta names attempt to take advantage of some game mechanic or game design choice. "Urist McHands" is a meta name because it is the default name for admin-spawned humans. "Operator Whiskey" is a meta name because it follows the naming pattern of nuclear operatives. This rule is not intended to prevent things like nuclear operatives using a fake ID with names that appear to be nuclear operative names if they decide that they want to do that.

  ## Conventions and Examples
