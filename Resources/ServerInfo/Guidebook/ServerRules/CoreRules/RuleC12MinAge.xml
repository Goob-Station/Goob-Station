  # Core Rule 12 - Players must be and act at least 14 years old
  All players must be at least 14 years old. Additionally, all players must act at least as mature as a 14 year old. Admins may ban someone who they believe is acting less mature than a 14 year old, even if the player is known to be significantly older than 14 years old.

  Anyone who connects to the servers is a player, even if they don't actually play in a round.
