  # Core Rule 5 - Players in vital job roles require a minimum amount of effort

  As a Head of Staff, you should be a reliable worker for your department, and are expected to perform the minimum duties of that role to the best of your ability. As an upside, being THE BOSS allows you to dictate the workflow of your department as you like, so long as you are reasonable - and have the ability to demote staff who do not comply, with similar protections that security is afforded for valid arrests.

  Notify admins if you must leave near round start for Command or AI roles.

  A reasonable effort should always be made to put yourself in cryosleep to open up your job slot.
