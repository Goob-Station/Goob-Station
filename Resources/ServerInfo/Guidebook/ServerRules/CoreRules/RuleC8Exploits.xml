  # Core Rule 8 - Do not exploit the game, use cheats, or macros
  The following are prohibited by this rule:
  - Bugs and exploits which have effects that persist beyond the current round,
  - Intentionally used bugs, exploits, and unintended behaviors which give the user an advantage over players who do not use them, even if their effects do not persist across rounds,
  - Evading or bypassing afk detection,
  - Anything which results in gaining elevated privileges, including admin permissions,
  - External tools and client modifications, including macros, and
  - Anything which prevents another player who is not game banned from being able to play on the servers, not including in-character actions that do not persist across rounds.
  - Using anything obviously broken and not acting in the way it's supposed to be used, such as a Radiation medicine dealing more damage than active poisons, or spraying Tajarans with waters to ash them.
  - Using chems to heal Cellular damage along with CPR to heal HOLLOWED bodies.
  Both attempts and successful use are prohibited.
