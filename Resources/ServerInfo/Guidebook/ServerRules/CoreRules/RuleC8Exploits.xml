  # Core Rule 8 - Do not exploit the game, use cheats, or macros
  The following are prohibited by this rule:
  - bugs and exploits which have effects that persist beyond the current round,
  - intentionally used bugs, exploits, and unintended behaviors which give the user an advantage over players who do not use them, even if their effects do not persist across rounds,
  - evading or bypassing afk detection,
  - anything which results in gaining elevated privileges, including admin permissions,
  - external tools and client modifications, including macros, and
  - anything which prevents another player who is not game banned from being able to play on the servers, not including in-character actions that do not persist across rounds.

  Both attempts and successful use are prohibited.
