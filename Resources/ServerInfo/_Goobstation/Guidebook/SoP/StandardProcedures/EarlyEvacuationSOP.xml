  # Early Evaucation Procedures
  These are the guidelines that should be followed as Command and Security when initiating early-launch procedures.

  1. Under [bold]no circumstances[/bold] should the evacuation shuttle be early launched when there is no [bold][italic]immediate[/italic][/bold] threat to the evacuation shuttle.

  2. The Command should wait as [bold]long as possible[/bold] before initiating early launch procedures.

  3. No member of Command or Station (with access to Command) should initiate early evacuation procedures until every participating member is ready.
  <Box>To clarify, there should not be individual inputs until everyone is ready, to prevent potential hostiles and/or thieves from taking IDs and starting it with adequate permissions.</Box>

  4. Early Evacuation should be called when a loosed material or threat were to harm the evacuation shuttle imminently. The following would be examples: Teslas, Singularities, Hostile Enemy Ships.

  5. Early Evacuation should be called when there are hostiles on the evacuation shuttle that are threatening the lives of the station personnel and bridge personnel.
  <Box>Said hostiles must be, in reasonable suspicion, unable to be taken down without significant loss of life to everyone currently on-board.</Box>

  6. Early Evacuation must be called when there is a Violet Alert to prevent potential specimens from arriving aboard the shuttle.
  <Box>If it is possible to defend the shuttle, this should be prioritized.</Box>
