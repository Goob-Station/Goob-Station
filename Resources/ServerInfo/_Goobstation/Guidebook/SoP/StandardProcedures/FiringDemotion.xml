# Dismissal/Demotion Policies
These are the policies/procedures that should be followed when dismissing or demoting personnel from a position.

<Box>[bullet/]If dismissed by Central Command orders, authorization for extra access should be given by Central Command.</Box>

2. In the event of a demotion, the relevant Head of Staff must choose whether to demote them to a lower rank in the Department or have them transferred to a Service position (with HoP approval).
