All of the resources in this directory and subdirectories under this are created/modified from existing (open-source) material by the following authors:
- Rouge2t7
- Tikibomb
- CerberusWolfie

with suggestions from other Staff Members of Goobstation.

The alert levels (all except Epsilon) are created by Funky Station (a downstream from Goobstation at this time).

Epsilon was created and modified from one of the others.

Why does this exist?
Primarily to make it easier to explain the formatting of this entire directory (and subdirectories).

Each subdirectory has the .xml file for that "folder" as it appears in the guidebook. The subdirectories and contents, including the main file in this directory,
are organized with the same formatting as appears in the guidebook in-game.
