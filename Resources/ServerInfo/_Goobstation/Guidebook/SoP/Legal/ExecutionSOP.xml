# Execution Procedures
These are the procedures that [bold]must[/bold] be followed by Security and Command when performing executions on any personnel on the station.

1. Prisoner's security status must be set to "*Dangerous*", and their relevant crimes entered into their sec record.
<Box>If they are crew but do not have a sec record, create a record in their name then set it as before. If they are not crew, this step can be skipped.</Box>

2. Prisoners must be cuffed and be clothed in a Prison Uniform and Shoes.

3. Prisoners must be stripped of all belongings. Said belongings should be placed in one of the prisoner gear lockers, and the prisoner equipped with standard prisoner uniform and headset.

4. Prisoners must be allowed their final words.

5. A Chaplain may be present if requested, and allowed by the Captain and/or Head of Security.

6. Authorization must be given by the Captain, Head of Security or Warden. If one is not present, follow the chain of command.
<Box>Should the Captain or appropriate Security personel be unable to provide authorization, it must come from Central Command.</Box>

7. Though not obligatory, it is recommended that all executed prisoners be considered for cyborgification post-execution.

8. Kill on sight orders are classified as executions, however due to the often chaotic situations in which these occur, security records must be updated (per point 1) within a reasonable amount of time after the order is given or carried out.
