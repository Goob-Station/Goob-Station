# Blueshield Officer (BSO) SOP
This is the list of procedures, responsibilities, and duties of the [color=#1b67a5][bold]Blueshield Officer[/bold][/color] of this station.

<ColorBox>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Center" Margin="10">
    The [color=#1b67a5][bold]Blueshield Officer[/bold][/color] should never be Captain nor Head of Staff.
  </Box>
</ColorBox>

The [bold][color=#fcd12a]most important[/color][/bold] rule of the Blueshield Officer is to protect and maintain the lives of Command personnel on the station.
<Box>Command personnel are personnel hired by Nanotrasen (confirmed personnel in command) and any Central Command officials (including NTR).</Box>

1. The Blueshield Officer is hired and entrusted with the sole responsibility of protecting command. They should only take action in matters related to command or upon request from command members, unless directed otherwise by Central Command.
  <Box>The Blueshield Officer should remain neutral on all conflicts between command staff, unless such leads to command fighting. They are then permitted to defuse the situation.</Box>

2. The Blueshield Officer is to put the lives of Command over the lives of all others, including the Blueshield Officer. Their well-being is top priority.
<Box>This includes first aid, revival, and ensuring they are safe and secure during emergencies.</Box>

3. The Blueshield Officer is to protect the lives of Command, not follow their orders to a fault.

4. The Blueshield Officer is not permitted to interfere with legal demotions or arrests. To do so would be a violation of their Central Command orders and Space Law.
<Box>This primarily pertains to Command and Security work.</Box>

5. The Blueshield Officer may use lethal force when actively protecting a member of Command from a clear and present danger. When the situation permits, they should warn transgressors that lethal force will be used if they continue their actions.

6. The Blueshield Officer, if multiple command members are threatened at once, should follow the Chain-Of-Command to know who to prioritize.
<Box>Central Command officials are to be prioritized over Command staff.  </Box>

7. The Blueshield Officer is not permitted any security gear other than that which is granted within their locker and on their person. This includes, but is not limited to: any form of accessing security communications, stinger grenades, security cartridge autoinjectors, et cetera.
<Box>An exception is made for handcuffs, should the Blueshield Officer wish to replace their zipties.</Box>
<Box>Additionally, if the Blueshield Officer is stripped of their arms and/or other supplies, they may arm themselves with any weapons or equipment available in the Armory, but never more than one at a time.</Box>
