  ## Green Alert
  1. Brigmedic must provide emergency medical care to prisoners, and most importantly, Security personnel. Brigmed should always prioritise brig. Failure to do so is grounds for HOS or Warden to terminate the brigmed's contract. 

  2. Brigmedic may conduct arrests, searches or any other Security procedures, however their number 1 priority is keeping security and prisoners health in check.

  3. Brigmedic may leave security at will, however they should prioritise warden or HOS' wishes if there's ever a conflict of interest. If a reasonable request is denied or ignored, their contract may be terminated.
  <Box>Exception is made if a Security member is down and requires rescue, or if they must visit the Medical department to replenish supplies.</Box>

  4. Brigmedic may carry any security equipment, but must respect alert levels. Similar to the detective, you've a more important role than just a security officer.

  ## Blue Alert
  1. Guidelines 1 and 2 are carried over from [color=#388c34]Green Alert[/color].

  ## Red Alert
  1. Guideline 1 is carried over from [color=#388c34]Green Alert[/color].

  2. Brigmedic is given the same authority and rights as Security Officers with the Head of Security's approval, but they should still prioritize the healing.
