    EVA Storage, Tech Storage, Gravity Generator, Engineering Secure Storage, AI Upload, Vault, Gateway, anywhere else requiring command level access that does not get regularly used.

    Secure areas such as EVA are to be left unbolted and ready to be used for their intended purposes.

    Exceptions are below;

    The Vault is not to be opened unless repairs are required, gold is required for Research and Development (in case Mining fails to deliver) or a critical item needs to be hidden in the safe.

    Searches of a person or department need to have a signed and stamped warrant by the Captain or HoP.

    [bold]General Crew:[/bold]

    While not required, it is recommended that the crew activate and maximize their Suit Sensors, due to the potential for workplace accidents;

    Free transit through the station is permitted for the crew, excluding Secure Areas.
