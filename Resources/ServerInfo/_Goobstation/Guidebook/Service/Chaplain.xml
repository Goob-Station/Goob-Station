# Chaplain
There's something about the vast infinity of space that turns men to prayer... Especially if they get thrown into it without a space suit.


As a chaplain, you would ideally proselytize whatever crazy religion you've made up for that round over your headset. However, besides your office, the hellish crematorium next to your office, and the rarely used morgue, you have no access.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Nullrod"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ArmamentsBeacon"/>
  </Box>

## Religions:
You are free to propagate any present day religions you know of, or even invent one of your own! Just make sure it doesn't go against NanoTrasen and its values, or you may well end up in the brig.

If you don't already have one, build an altar and find an offering to place on-top:

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarBananium"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarChaos"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarDruid"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarClock"/>
  </Box>

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarConvertMaint"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarNanotrasen"/>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarSpaceChristian"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarTechnology"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarToolbox"/>
  </Box>
