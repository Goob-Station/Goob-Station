Modern technology allows space creatures like you and I to automate the movement of liquids.

Research and build a liquid pump and some automation upgrade kits.
You can upgrade certain liquid handling machines like ChemMasters and industrial reagent grinders.
Link the pump to the Plumbing Input/Output ports and it will start pumping.

Pumps can only transfer between 2 machines, but you can click them to assign a filter. Only that filtered reagent will be moved by the pump.
Use multiple pumps for advanced stuff.

Because it's just multitool based you don't need to build any pipes or anything, just link pumps to machines and watch the liquids move!
