  Revolutionaries are conversion antagonists sponsored by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate[/color] who are tasked with taking control of the station. They have no fancy gimmicks or cheap tricks, they only have a cause and strength in numbers.

  ## Objectives
  You must cuff, kill, convert, or exile all of the [textlink="Command staff" link="Command"] on station in no particular order.

  Your objective is not to destroy the station, but [italic]take it over[/italic], so try to minimize damage where possible.

  [bold]The revolution will fail[/bold] if all of the [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] die or all their hypnotic abilities will be disabled with MindShield implant, and all [color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] will de-convert if this happens.

  ## Headrevs & Conversion
  [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] are chosen at the start of the shift and begin with a [color=cyan]flash[/color], [color=cyan]syndicate encryption key[/color] and a pair of [color=cyan]sunglasses[/color].

  You can convert crew members to your side by taking any [bold]flash[/bold] and attacking someone with it using [color=#ff0000]harm mode[/color].
  However, you can't convert your target if they're wearing [color=cyan]flash protection[/color] such as [bold]sunglasses[/bold] or a [bold]welding mask[/bold].

  Another hurdle in your way are pesky [color=cyan]mindshield implanters[/color]. These will:
  - Prevent the implanted person from being converted into a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color]
  - De-convert Revolutionaries, and will make them no longer loyal to your cause
  - Visibly change appearance upon being implanted into a [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold], giving away his cover and disabling your convert ability
  - NOT protect against flash disorientation

  Assume all of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] and [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] are implanted with mindshields already.

  ## Fight against MindShield

  MindShield implant can be ejected from your target by using empty [color = cyan]implanter[/color] that can be made on [color = yellow]medical techfab[/color] that can be found in medical department.

  When implant ejected your can convert your target, including command and security.

  If your convert ability was disabled by [color=cyan]mindshield implant[/color] you just need to remove mindshield implant to turn on your ability back.

  ## Revolutionary
  A [bold][color=red]Revolutionary[/color][/bold] is a crew member that has been converted by a [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold].

  [bold][color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] can't convert people themselves,[/bold] but they're more than capable of doing dirty work and carrying out orders.
