  # The Xenomorphs

  ## Overview

  Xenomorphs are a mid-round antagonist team of extraterrestrial lifeforms that use hosts to reproduce.
  Their goal is to build a nest, grow their numbers, and take over the station.

  ## Fighting the Xenomorphs

  To fight xenomorphs, you must weld the vents to stop their movement.
  Protect your face from facehuggers with riot or hardsuit helmets.
  Xenomorphs are weak to fire, so use flamethrowers and welders.
  Use ranged energy weapons and kill weak Larva on sight.
  If a crewmate is implanted, a surgeon in Medbay can remove the larva quickly.
  The main priority is to find the nest and kill the Queen to stop their reproduction.
