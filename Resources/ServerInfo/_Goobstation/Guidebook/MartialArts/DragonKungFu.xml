  ## Special abilities

  ### Riposte

  With lightning reflexes, a Dragon Kung Fu master has a chance to parry any incoming melee attack. In that brief moment, the attacker is left vulnerable,
  Leaving an opening for the Dragon Kung Fu to Strike back and stun them automatically, unless they are also a Dragon Kung Fu Master. A Magestic response to any assault, Imitating the Wings of a Dragon.
