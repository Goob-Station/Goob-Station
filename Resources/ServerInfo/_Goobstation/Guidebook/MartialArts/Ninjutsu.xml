  Ninjutsu is a [textlink="martial art" link="MartialArts"] thoroughly developed by the Spider Clan.
  Space Ninjas are true masters of this technique, yet Space Wizards may also unravel its secrets.
  Remember your four teachings. Never move around loud. Only strike when unseen. Patience prevails, haste fails. Death comes in silence.

  ## Special abilities

  ### Sneak Attack

  In the shadow of stillness, the Ninja's strike shall echo with the force of two. Doubles the damage for next melee attack.
  Once harm is dealt, the sneakiness fades, retreating into swiftness, waiting for the next chance to rise.
  Enables Ninjutsu Takedown and Assassinate, disables Swift Strike.

  ### Loss of Surprise

  In the silence of an opening, the ninja moves like a whisper in the wind.
  Speed is their weapon, and the moment to strike is fleeting, like a shadow in the dark.
  Lasts 5 seconds. Disables Ninjutsu Takedown and Assassinate but enables Swift Strike.

  ### Escape Plan

  Your target has perished. It is time to leave and plan your next attack.

  After a successful kill, the ninja's spirit sharpens and quickens. Their movement speed increases temporally,
  gliding through shadow and blood alike â€” unseen, unstoppable, and already gone before the next breath is drawn.

  ## Combo attacks

  ### Assasinate

  Deals massive damage to the target if Sneak Attack is active.
  Works in unarmed combat or Left Mouse Button attacks with a Slash damage weapon. Works much worse against armored opponents

  ### Ninjutsu Takedown

  Only works with active Sneak Attack. Slows the opponent down significantly and mutes them.
  Works better if performed from behind.

  ### Swift Strike

  When the foe is knocked down, melee weapon dealing slash strike comes faster than the eye can follow.
  And unarmed, each attack will drain the opponent's stamina. Only works with Loss of Surprise active.

  ### Bite The Dust
