  Krav Maga is a self-defence [textlink="martial art" link="MartialArts"] that was developed by ancient militaries on Terra six centuries ago.
  It can be learned through years of training or be given to a user by advanced nanomachines stored inside gloves.
  On the station, a singular pair of Krav Maga Gloves can be found the Warden's locker. Syndicate antagonists can use Krav Maga Implant for the same effect.

  ## Action Combat

  Krav Maga attacks aren't like the combos of most martial arts. The user must instead ready the attack they
  wish to use in the action bar, then follow it up by performing Harm action on the opponent as normal.
