  Close Quarters Combat, or simply CQC, is a [textlink="martial art" link="MartialArts"] that focuses on swiftly and efficiently
  dispatching your target, with simple but powerful combos that lack the more outlandish moves of other martial arts.
  CQC is primarily an aggressive fighting style that focuses on dealing stamina damage to targets - designed to quickly subdue
  opponents and overpower them with pressure technique and crushing blows. This art requires a thorough knowledge of intents.

  It is usually used by Syndicate antagonists, however Chefs also get access to it. In Chef's case, CQC obviously stands
  for Close Quarters Cooking, and Chefs don't cook outside of kitchen, so they are unable to use CQC away from it.

  ## Special abilities

  CQC users are better at Disarm intent, as their shoves will deal extra stamina damage to the opponent.

  ### Riposte

  With lightning reflexes, a CQC master has a chance to parry any incoming melee attack. In that brief moment, the attacker is left vulnerable,
  so the CQC master strikes back and stuns them automatically, unless they are also a CQC master. A calculated, deadly response to any assault.

  ### Neck Snap

  There is no escape from a choke grab of a CQC master. With a single Harm action to the head, the victim's neck breaks,
  killing them instantly. No armor can shield against this deadly precision. The end comes swiftly, and without mercy.
