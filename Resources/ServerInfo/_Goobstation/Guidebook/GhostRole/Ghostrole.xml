  Ghost Roles are special roles accessible to ghosts, allowing them to join back in the round as a new character.
  Their exact intentions can range heavily, some being able to match if not surpass the ability of some roundstart antagonists.
  Some can spawn at the start of a round, but most spawn later into a shift.
