# Structural Damage Procedures
In the event of massive structural damage to the station, Command should set the alert to [color=#c8a404]Yellow Alert[/color] and notify Engineering of the location of the damage.

1. Engineering personnel should be allowed access to the damage site (in the event of the location being in a different department and inaccessible).

2. Engineering should be given priority for materials to rebuild the section for a safe state.

3. Engineering should repressurize the area to prevent pressure lockout.

4. All secure areas that are affected should be completely sealed off and returned to a secure state, confirmed by Security/Command.

5. Once all damage has been dealt with, Engineering is to give the all clear with confirmation from Command, and the alert should be set to a safe alert.
