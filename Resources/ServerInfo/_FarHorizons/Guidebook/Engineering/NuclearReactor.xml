	# Nuclear Generator

	The Nuclear Generator generates power by heating a gas through fission reactions in a Nuclear Reactor, which then spins a Gas Turbine.

	## The Nuclear Reactor
	<Box>
		<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BaseNuclearReactor"/>
	</Box>

	The Nuclear Reactor is the primary source of heat the generator uses to make power.

	It is represented as a 7x7 grid of Reactor Rod ports, which engineers can insert different fabricated rods into.

	Heat is generated through fission reactions inside fuel rods and transferred into the coolant gas by gas channels.

	Reactor Rods are the parts that go into the Reactor grid and cause it to function.

	They transfer heat and interact with neutrons within the Reactor.

	If a Reactor Rod's [bold]Temperature[/bold] reaches 1700 kelvin, it will begin to melt.

	Once melted it will become much more active and able to transfer heat into the Reactor, which may cause a total meltdown.

	Handling hot Reactor Rods can cause serious burns.

	If it is hotter than 80C you'll need gloves to be able to handle them. At 500C, not even gloves will protect you.

	There are four different types of Reactor Rods that can be manufactured from a variety of materials and placed into the Reactor grid: Fuel Rods, Control Rods, Gas Channels, and Heat Exchangers.

	### Fuel Rods
	Fuel Rods are the source of neutrons and heat within the Reactor.

	They can emit neutrons through spontaneous decay and from interacting with existing neutrons, which also creates heat.

	They have two statistics that determine their effectiveness and volatility:
	- [bold]Neutron Radioactivity[/bold]: Creates high-energy neutrons and large amounts of heat. Decays into Radioactivity.
	- [bold]Radioactivity[/bold]: Creates neutrons and heat. Decays into Spent Fuel.

	They also keep track of how much [bold]Spent Fuel[/bold] they contain, which does not affect the Fuel Rod's performance, but can indicate when it is time to replace it.

	</Box>

	Once a Fuel Rod contains enough [bold]Spent Fuel[/bold], it can be reprocessed by a nuclear centrifuge to create plutonium, which can be used to make plutonium fuel rods.

	### Control Rods
	Control rods control the flow of neutrons within the Reactor.

	They have the unique property of being able to be adjusted, which changes how effective they are.

	They control the reaction by limiting the number of neutrons that go through them and into a Fuel Rod.

	### Gas Channels
	Gas Channels transfer heat from themselves into the coolant gas that flows through them.

	Each Gas Channel will increase the flow rate by [bold]100 L/s[/bold], allowing the Reactor to process more gas at once.

	### Heat Exchangers
	Heat Exchangers guide the spread of heat within the Reactor.

	They are exceptionally good at transferring heat and don't interact with neutrons, making them ideal for getting heat from a Fuel Rod into a Gas Channel without interfering with the fission process.

	## Controlling the Reactor
	The Reactor is controlled and modified through its UI, which also provides information on the Reactor's status.

	The Reactor UI has three major panels: Targeting, Grid View, Status Panel

	### Targeting
	The targeting panel has controls for inserting and removing rods into and out of the Reactor grid.

	The X and Y position of the target are adjusted through the +X, -X and +Y, -Y buttons.

	Reactor Rods can be inserted or removed through the Insert/Remove button below the position buttons.

	If there is a Reactor Rod at the target position, it will show information on that Reactor Rod, including its:
	- Name
	- Temperature (T)
	- Neutron Radioactivity (N)
	- Radioactivity (R)
	- Spent Fuel (S)

	The bottom of the panel displays the name of the part that has been removed from the Reactor or is ready to be inserted.

	### Grid View
	The grid view gives a graphic visualization of the status of the Reactor grid.

	The Change View button can be used to alternate between the different views:
	- Temperature View: shows the temperature of the components
	- Neutron View: shows the number of neutrons at any given position
	- Target View: shows the current target location

	### Status Panel
	The status panel gives information on the Reactor as a whole and provides control of the control rods.

	The [bold]Temperature Gauge[/bold] shows the current temperature of the Reactor, in a range between 0 and 2000 kelvin.

	If the Reactor ever reaches 2000 kelvin, it will [color=red]meltdown[/color].

	The [bold]Radiation Gauge[/bold] shows the current radiation being emitted by the Reactor, in a range between 0 and 50 rads.

	The [bold]Thermal Power Gauge[/bold] shows an estimation of the amount of thermal power being made by the Reactor, in a range between 0 and 10 000 000 thermal watts (Wt).

	Thermal Power is a decent estimation of how much power can be extracted from the gas by the [bold]Turbine[/bold].

	Thermal Power has a tendency to increase and decrease as the Reactor runs, rarely remaining stable.

	The [bold]Control Rod Gauges[/bold] show the actual and set insertion levels of the control rods within the Reactor, and provide buttons to change the insertion level.

	## Cooling the Reactor
	The Reactor is cooled through the use of gasses, but some gasses have effects on the Reactor when in sufficient quantities:

	<Box>
		<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PlasmaCanister" Caption=""/>
	</Box>
	[color=#ff3300][bold]Plasma[/bold][/color] has a reactive effect, creating more neutrons and decaying into [color=#13ff4b][bold]Tritium[/bold][/color].

	If there is enough plasma within the Reactor, it may end up going into a runaway reaction and [color=red]melting down[/color].

	<Box>
		<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CarbonDioxideCanister" Caption=""/>
	</Box>
	[color=#4e4e4e][bold]Carbon Dioxide[/bold][/color] has a moderative effect, removing neutrons that come into contact with it.

	This can be used to regulate a plasma reaction or slow down the Reactor.

	<Box>
		<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="TritiumCanister" Caption=""/>
	</Box>
	[color=#13ff4b][bold]Tritium[/bold][/color] transmutes within a Reactor, randomly decaying into a wide variety of gasses:
	- [color=#2887e8][bold]Oxygen[/bold][/color]
	- [color=#FF0000][bold]Nitrogen[/bold][/color]
	- [color=#56941e][bold]Ammonia[/bold][/color]
	- [color=#8f00ff][bold]Nitrous Oxide[/bold][/color]
	- [color=#3a758c][bold]Frezon[/bold][/color]

	In the presence of [color=#2887e8][bold]Oxygen[/bold][/color] and at the temperatures of the Reactor, [color=#13ff4b][bold]Tritium[/bold][/color] will begin to burn, [color=red]creating large amounts of heat[/color].

	## Reactor Radiation
	<Box>
		<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SignRadiation" Caption=""/>
	</Box>
	The Reactor sometimes allows some radiation to leak out, which can pose a danger to unprotected crew.

	The radiation level of the Reactor is determined by how many neutrons are escaping the Reactor grid.

		<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GeigerCounter"/>
	</Box>

	Proper protection and shielding are highly recommended when working near the Reactor.


	## The Gas Turbine
	<Box>
		<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Turbine"/>
	</Box>

	The Gas Turbine is where the power actually gets made.

	It takes in hot gas from the Reactor and outputs electricity and sends colder gas back to the Reactor.

	The amount of energy made by the Turbine is affected by its set Flow Rate and Stator Load, and by its RPM.

	### Flow Rate
	The Flow Rate determines how much gas goes through the Turbine every second.

	The higher the Flow Rate, the higher the RPM of the Turbine.

	Flow Rate is usually set to allow maximum flow through the Reactor core, which can be found by the following equation: 100 * number of gas channels + 200.

	### Stator Load
	The Stator Load determines how much power is made by each revolution of the Turbine.

	The higher the Stator Load, the lower the RPM of the Turbine.

	Stator Load is usually adjusted to ensure the Turbine stays at optimal RPM.

	### RPM
	The RPM (Rotations Per Minute) represents how fast the Turbine is spinning.

	The Turbine has an optimal RPM, where it will produce the most power.

	Going faster or slower than optimal will result in poor performance.

	## Turbine Status Indicators
	The Turbine has a set of status indicators to warn operators of dangerous conditions or faults.

	### Overspeed
	The Turbine RPM is too high.

	If the Turbine RPM gets too high, it will start to take damage.

	Prolonged time spent at overspeed or excessive overspeed will cause the Turbine to [color=red]tear itself apart[/color].

	Damage to the Turbine can be repaired with a [color=yellow]welder[/color], though it will likely take multiple attempts to fully repair it.

	### Overtemp
	The gas going into the Turbine is too hot.

	If the gas coming into the Turbine is hotter than 3000 kelvin, it will trigger an emergency purge valve and dump the gas into the room.

	This hot gas can cause serious burns to personnel or even a fire, if the gas is flammable.

	### Stalling
	The stator load is too high or the gas is not hot enough.

	Stalling is where the gas going into the Turbine isn't "pushing" hard enough to overcome the stator load's resistance.

	### Undertemp
	The gas going into the Turbine is too cold.

	If the gas is at or below room temperature (20C), there is no energy for the Turbine to take out of it.


	# Starting the Nuclear Generator
	To start the Nuclear Generator, engineers must follow these steps:
	- Fill the coolant loop with a gas.
	- Set the Turbine's Flow Rate according to the Reactor setup.
	- Insert the Fuel Rods into the empty spots in the Reactor grid, typically by a control rod(s) and surrounded by heat exchangers and gas channels.
	- Retract the Control Rods to start warming up the Reactor.
	- As the Reactor warms up, engineers will want to keep adjusting the Turbine's Stator Load to maintain optimal RPM.
	- Once the Turbine is making enough power for the station, the Control Rods should be inserted to the point of maintaining Reactor temperature.

	Over time, the Fuel Rods will lose radioactivity, meaning the Control Rods should be retracted further or the fuel rods replaced.
