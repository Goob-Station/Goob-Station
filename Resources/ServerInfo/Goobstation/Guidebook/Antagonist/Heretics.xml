  # How to be a Heretic 101
  So you're a Heretic? Well, get ready for magic and battle. Grab influences, complete sacrifices, accomplish rituals, and ascend to godhood.

  You are a nasty little bookworm in search of truth and power, and you have arrived on a station ripe with opportunities. Your ultimate goal is to ascend and become all powerful, but to do that you must gain knowledge.
  All knowledges cost 1 point, except for "public" ones, which are accessible from any path, or Ascensions.

  You can gain knowledge points and become stronger through a few ways:
  - Draining influences that spawn randomly around the station.
  - Sacrificing crew members your dark patrons hunger for.
  - Automatically getting one knowledge point every 20 minutes.

  ## Eldritch Influences

  Influences are the easy way to gain power points. Whenever there are Heretics aboard Space Station 14, influences will randomly spawn across the station.
  They are not visible to the naked eye of a crew member, hovewer they [bold]will[/bold] become visible after harvesting, aside from suddenly changing colors.

  ## Heretical Research
  Once you have some power points, it's time to research! Open up your knowledge store using the action button.
  The research menu forms a branching tree, and your first selection will be to commit to a path that defines your initial abilities and Final Ascension.
  You can earn abilities from other paths to a limited degree, but overall your chosen path will heavily influence your play-style.

  ## Transmutation is Key
  Eventually, you'll need to start using proper magics. To draw a transmutation rune, you'll need a writing tool, such as a pen or crayon.
  Activate [color=green]Mansus Grasp[/color] in your offhand and click on the floor to start drawing a rune.
  These runes are highly noticeable and take up a 3x3 area.
  You can freely remove runes by using your pen with the activated [color=green]Mansus Grasp[/color] on it, and you can also freely use other Heretic's runes.

  To [bold]transmute[/bold], simply click the rune with your empty hand to choose the needed ritual, after that use your [color=green]Mansus Grasp[/color] on the rune to see what objects you require for the ritual.
  You can always see your chosen ritual by [bold]inspecting[/bold] the rune.

  Transmutation Rituals allow you to create powerful artifacts, demonic monsters, and many useful tools that will help you progress towards ultimate power.

  ## Focus is Necessary
  To cast more advanced spells, you must focus by wearing an [color=orange]Amber Focus[/color].
  You can acquire Ambes Focus using the eponymous ritual.
  Some more powerful heretical equipment also functions as a focus - namely, the Ominous Armor from the Armorer's Ritual (when the hood is flipped up).
  [color=yellow]Ascension[/color] disables the need for a focus.

  ## Starting Knowledge
  - \[ [color=red]Heartbeat of the Mansus[/color] \] - Allows you to sacrifice targets who are in critical or worse condition to the Mansus, sending them to the Shadow Realm and rewarding you with one knowledge point; or two if your victim was a head of staff.
  - \[ [color=red]Amber Focus[/color] \] - Allows you to transmute a sheet of glass and a pair of eyes into an Amber Focus. This is a small neck-worn item that allows you to cast more advanced Heretic spells while worn.

  ## Tips
  - [color=orange]Amber Focus[/color] is a very powerful item - it allows you to harvest double the points from influences!
  - Unlike most other solo antagonists, Heretics start weak but grow stronger over time. It would be best not to attract too much attention to yourself until you unlock more powerful spells and equipment.
  - Each influence can only be harvested once, so the heretic that goes the fastest and grabs the most influences first has to do less killing and sacrificing to reach their ascensions.
  - Your Mansus Grasp will temporarily garble the speech of people who you use it on. This can let you get away with murder while comms are online, but be careful - it's not foolproof!
  - [color=purple]Influences[/color] can spawn in almost any location on the station, ranging from the main hallways and public restrooms to [color=cyan]Command staff offices[/color] and [color=red]restricted security areas[/color] in the Brig. It's best to check every area you can access, public and department.
  - By default, nothing on you is incriminating. If security suspects you, but can't actually pin anything heretical on you, you might be able to pass off as a Traitor instead.
  - Monkeys and other animals make for great, usually non-suspicious sources of organs or corpses for your heretical rituals.
  - Most summoned monsters will drop the components used to create them on death. While having them to die is not ideal, you can easily grab the parts and summon another.
