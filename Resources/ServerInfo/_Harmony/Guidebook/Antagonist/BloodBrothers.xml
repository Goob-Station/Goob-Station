  Blood Brothers are a team of two people working together to complete a list of objectives. These objectives are mostly equal to the objectives given to [textlink="Traitors" link="Traitors"].

  ## What to do

  ### Finding a suitable crewmember

  The first thing you will want to do is to find a suitable crewmember.

  You can do so by using the "Check If Convertible" action automatically given to you.

  This action will quietly check and tell you if someone is possible to convert or not.

  You will not be able to convert anyone who is mindshielded or anyone who has blood brothers turned off in their character creation panel.

  ### Converting a crewmember

  After finding a suitable and convertible crewmember, you will want to convert them to your side.

  To do so, you must first bring them to a hidden location where no one will see and then use the "Convert" action. This action is [bold]very visible[/bold], do not use it in public.

  The crewmember will then become your blood brother, with the objective to help you with your objectives.
