  While these creatures can be helpful, there is still a risk in letting them into your body. Wearing a helmet will prevent them from entering your body at all. Ingesting sugar will prevent it from getting into your body and suppress the abilities of one already inside. They can be removed from your body with a surgery to the brain, but it's recommended to consume sugar first, lest they take over your body during the procedure.
