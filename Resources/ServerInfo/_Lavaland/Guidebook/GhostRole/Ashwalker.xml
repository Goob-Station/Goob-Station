  A subspecies of Reptilians that fiercly protect their land, and usually attack any miners who tresspass their terriroty. By using a Necropolis Tendril, the Ash Walkers are able to grow and hatch their eggs through the sacrifice of dead bodies.
  Due to them being tribals, they are mostly incapable of using more advanced technology.

  Due to living on a more harsh enviorment, they prove to be slightly quicker and more resilient then most other species typically encountered.
  Their claws are also more sharp then a Reptilians, dealing extra damage, although they will still likely rely on their usual weapons.

  If the Ash Walkers fail to properly defend their tendril from hostile miners, it will collapse, and the Ash Walkers will be doomed.
