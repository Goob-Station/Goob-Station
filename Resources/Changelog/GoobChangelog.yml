        Damage has been partially reworked! Now instead of your body taking

        amount of healing they need to do.

      message: >-
        Added traumas! Consequences for damage which are associated with wound
        infliction. They are rolled for by chance based on the type of wound.
        For instance a slash wound would have a VERY high chance to inflict a
        delimbing trauma. And a blunt wound would have a very high chance to
        inflict organ damage and bone damage traumas. Each trauma has a minimum
        damage threshold that an attack must inflict in order to do its thing.

        Added a pain & consciousness system. For now its temporarily disabled,
        but the gist of it is that your brain is a nerveous system, which is
        connected to a bunch of nerves. Each body part is a nerve, and by taking
        damage, this contributes to the overall pain of the entity, which causes
        consequences at different levels. Ideally I want it to work like
        Monkestation's where it also doubles as a vascular system-lite with
        somewhat balanced values.
