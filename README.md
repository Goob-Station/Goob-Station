_ShibaStation_ is a fork of _Goob-Station_, which is itself a fork of _Space Station 14_. This fork is primarily for features that may not fit with or be approved by the _Goob-Station_ team, as well as being adjusted for a MRP environment, however any general fixes are submitted to the original repo for everyone's benefit.

If you want to host or create content for _SS14_, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) as it contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs and is the base for your fork.
