# Reporting a security vulnerability
You can report a security vulnerability through Discord.

If you want to contact us through Discord, you can join [the GoobStation discord](https://discord.com/invite/RNXByxPh7d)
and then **privately** message the owner of the server; If you need to report a vulnerability in Space Station 14 / Robust.Toolbox, follow THEIR security.md.

 The #1 rule is: **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give you permission to do so**.
